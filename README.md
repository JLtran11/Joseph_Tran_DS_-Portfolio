The repository contains all the files associated with the second capstone project: Loan default prediction.

- Reduced large column space of anonymized features (755) via feature selection methods to create 3 data sets for modeling.
- Performed statistical analysis using qq plots for normality and t-tests for target class inference.
- Optimized logistic regression, adaboost, random forest, and xgboost using pipeline and random search to find optimal model
- Selected xgboost model for further tuning to optimize for reducing false negatives, reduce over-fitting to train data, and robustness   to imbalanced target class.
